## Setup React Project without create-react-app cli tool

Referred https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deyxI-6C2u4 to setup the project. It took lot of efforts to set correct version in package.json based on webpack 5. Video is old and illustrate for webpack 4. There are bugs in some of webpack versions like 4.20 etc. Still webpack-dev-server not running for me. Using webpack serve instead to acheive same.
